# Purpose

A wrapper linux shell script for NVIDIA nvcc that:
1. Accepts *host* compiler and linker command line arguments and decorates these arguments to properly pass through nvcc.
2. Accepts file names with conventional C and C++ suffixes and decorates these arguments to properly pass to nvcc.
  
# Maintenance and Improvement

This script is intended to be a CUDA-user community maintained and improved resource.
